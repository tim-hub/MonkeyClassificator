# About Our Awesome Monkeys Classificator

This is a very basic prototype to use the model we build for our machine learning assignment which is based on the data provided by Kaggle.com.

To use it, the model is required, which can be found in the [kernel output](https://www.kaggle.com/timdata/93-tranfer-learning-inception-v3-more-epochs/output).

## Stacks
